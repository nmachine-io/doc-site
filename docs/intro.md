# Documentation for Publishers

Welcome to the NMachine documentation site. Here you will find the resources to
build your application-specific platform to share with your team, your clients, 
or the world.

If you're looking to _use_ existing NMachine apps, 
head over to [an.nmachine.io](https://an.nmachine.io). Otherwise, choose where to go from here:

## Learn the Concepts

Before jumping into the SDK, build an understanding of NMachine by skimming over the 
[Concepts section](/concepts/concepts-root.md).


## Build a Platform from A-to-Z

Learn the SDK by doing. Open an IDE and build your first platform with the [A to Z Walkthrough](/walkthrough/getting-started.md).

## Surf the SDK Models Reference

You can move fast by leveraging core NMachine Models. Surf the comprehensive 
[Models Reference](/models/models-overview.md).
