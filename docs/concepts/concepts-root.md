# System Overview

## What is NMachine?

**For a quick and dirty understanding**, think of NMachine as the intersection of:
- A Helm wrapper
- A Platform as Code SDK
- A Kubernetes App-store
- An application-specifig Heroku / Internal Dev Platform

**Or in wordier terms**, NMachine gives you an SDK to build an application-specific platform 
for a Kubernetes application, where operational knowledge is digitized,
so that unfamiliar users may install/operate/troubleshoot/update 
said application with confidence at the production-level on their own infrastructure. Publishers can 
then leverage rich distribution features from our cloud-based dashboard, such as
telemetry access, release channels, payments/licenses, and rule-based last-minute configuration.

## Digitizing Operational Knowlege

What, specifically, can a publisher instruct their platform to do?
