# Deployment: Where do things Run?

If a user installs an app with NMachine, where is everything running?

- **The application itself** is running directly on the user's cluster.
- **The NMachine client** can be a desktop app on the user's computer, or a web app in the cloud
- **The [KAMA](/concepts/kama-concept) server** can be in the user's cluster or in the cloud
- **The [KTEA](/concepts/ktea-concept) server(s)** can run in the user's cluster, or in the cloud 
(server<u>**s**</u> because of [plugins](/concepts/plugins-concept.md))
