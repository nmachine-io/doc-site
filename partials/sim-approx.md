# The case for a competing branch in AI

My thoughts on intelligence.

## AI: What not to Do

The bad goals hurting us:
- insane human caching
- insane human mixing types one-two
- non-intelligence that infuences thought

Even within what seems to be perfect reason/logic we have superpowers:
- finding the right level of resolution/approx (i.e not need to reduce "where is the cup" to particle physics)

If our goal is to create sentient beings, then ML-based outer loops might cut it. 

Ex

The deepthing for sols. Humans' outer loop is likely instinct, and we call upon 
a computational resource that we call reason. R* is that exactly backwards.

Discard everything, try building R*.
- our approx superpowers

Sols section, organize by possibilities:
- Francois Cholet - (statistical) optimize for generality itself
- Mine: regression calculus

New vocab:
	- A word for someone who has a lot of something and finds perverse/comfortable pleasure in deriding that thing
		- Like rich socialists and intelligent "crows are intelligent" people


The big compiler analogy. We can often explainn a lower level cog func after the facts
in what seems to be perfect logical form. But the perfect form is not the actual source.
The million dollar question is whether there exists way to generate the source. This is 
even true when we actively try to use pure reasoning: in programming -> you write logic,
come back later to find out there is a better representation (better abstraction).

If our "higher source" can be used to run the machine, then R* is real.

Sols:
	- if source can be retrieved:
		- neuro sym AI?
		- explainability?
	else:
		- self code
		- 


Examples of human magic: 
	- I was looking for a power outlet. Quickly spinning my head around, and my attention was
	immediately brought to these blocky things (took pic Fri aug 6)


## The AI I Want: Doing 20% of Human Cognition 20x Better

I don't care

Steve Jobs thing, what to say no to.

### The Cognition Soup: Reference story

Anna, a Portuguese expat, stands in line at a popular bagel shop 
in New York. It's important she gets three particular bagels from this particular
place (e.g to schmooze clients in an upcoming meeting). With five customers ahead 
of her and only four of the required bagels left, there's a real risk she won't 
get the three she needs, which would be a disaster. 

She suspects that one of the 20-somethings behind the counter may 
be Brazilian; his accent suggests it. She breathes in, 
wipes the stress from her face in favor of her pleasant features,  
sidesteps the line to the meet the employee at the counter, and puts on a giddy act: 
"I've never been here, what's good?", "You're from Sao Paulo!?",
etc... Then, finally: "I really hope [the required bagels] don't sell out!". 
The flustered Brazilian whispers "I'll set them aside for you" and winks.  

### Extracting Reasoning from the Cognition Soup 

Anna achieved her goal. How did she do it? Three things enabled her:
**Temperament**. 
- The reward was sufficiently _motivating_ to kick off an action
- She overcame discomfort of gaze of others 
**Instinct**. She correctly guessed the man was Brazilian. This is standard Machine Learning: annotate 
voice recordings with nationality and you can get human-level. 
**Reasoning** => Simulation Theory


**Method: Look at reasoning and nothing else**.




We all want the same thing from AI: robot janitors. We want 
the metaphors that ML-based AI has 
brazenly appropriated - learning, improving, understanding - to become real.


## Part 1: Approximation Hypothesis

I first propose an looking upo aggressive 

The brain is too messy, too interconnected, for us to 
read its ultimate secret: intelligence.

The next time you observe an intelligent agent - a person - exhibiting
intelligent behavior, try decomposing the behavior into three parts:
- Temperament => Psychology 
- Instinct => Machine Learning
- Reasoning => Simulation Theory



# Part 2: Simulation Theory

have brought a coat?)
